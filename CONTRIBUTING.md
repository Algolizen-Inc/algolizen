# Contributing Guidelines

Welcome to the team! This document outlines the process and rules for contributing to this repository. Even without enforced branch protections, we follow a disciplined Git flow to maintain code quality and collaboration standards.

## Branching Strategy

- `main`: Stable, deployable code. Protected by policy (not enforcement).
- `dev`: Staging branch for upcoming features.
- `feature/xyz`: Feature branches (e.g., `feature/login-ui`)
- `fix/xyz`: Bugfix branches (e.g., `fix/api-timeout`)

**Do not push directly to `main`.** All changes must go through a Pull Request.

---

## Workflow

1. **Fork or clone** the repo.
2. **Create a new branch** from `dev`:
   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git pull
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

3. Make changes locally and commit.


4. Push your branch to origin:

git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name


5. Open a Pull Request to dev.


6. Request review from appropriate team members.




---

Pull Request Guidelines

Provide a clear title and description.

Link related issues: Closes #issue-number

Follow PR template if available.

Include screenshots or tests if relevant.



---

Commit Message Convention

Use this format for clarity and changelog automation:

type(scope): short summary

body (optional)

Examples:

feat(auth): add JWT-based login
fix(api): handle 500 errors in user endpoint


---

Code Reviews

At least one review required before merging.

Use inline comments for suggestions.

Don't merge your own PR unless discussed.



---

Code Owners

Certain folders require approval from specific contributors.

See .github/CODEOWNERS for details.


---

CI/CD and Testing

All PRs will trigger GitHub Actions for tests and linting. Ensure your code passes:

Unit tests

Lint checks (npm run lint, black, etc.)



---

Stay Synced

Before pushing, always:

git pull origin dev --rebase

Keep it clean, keep it tight.


---

Thanks for contributing—let's build responsibly.
